IDEAS/TODO:

* Tasks

** DONE org-table to lisp
   :PROPERTIES:
   :suggested-by: Stephan Schmitt
   :END:
use

Eric, did you know that Carsten provided a function called 
org-table-to-lisp in org-6.06b?  I think with this you can 
refactor your code to be more modular and thus better 
maintainable and extensible.

** DONE 3d plotting
** TODO add plot links
   :PROPERTIES:
   :suggested-by: Carsten Dominik
   :END:
something like

[[plot:table]]

not sure what the part following the : should contain, possibly
options

maybe rather than a plot it should look more like the latex in org
format?? $ $

** TODO support for plotting formulas
gnuplot has capabilities for plotting formulas, this would make sense
as the contents of a =[plot: ]= style link

maybe something like

=[splot:sin(sqrt(x**2+y**2))/sqrt(x**2+y**2)]=

which could read options from a =#+PLOT= line in the same way as
plotting tables...

** TODO histogram support (with automatic bin size)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :suggested-by: Samuel Wales
   :END:

1.  For a selected column, it can be nice to draw a histogram.  Long
ago, I developed the following formula for choosing a bin size.  Seems
to work.

        5*(max-min)/n

You can use something like bin*round*($1 * (1.0/bin)) to bin.  Note
that cl-extra.el's (round*) might be more consistent and
mathematically vetted than (round) (though you might not be allowed to
use cl-extra.el).

** TODO automatic descriptive statistics with plot
   :PROPERTIES:
   :suggested-by: Samuel Wales
   :END:

2.  It might be nice to show descriptive statistics (I would show
mean, median, geometric mean, standard deviation, min, max, range)
somewhere while showing the plot, if you don't already do this.
** TODO re-graph all graphs when publishing
important sub-problem is how to cycle through all graphs, especially
cycling through and re-graphing all graphs in a subtree, like the
latex image command. (maybe even displaying the graph over the plot
link.

** TODO sources of data to plot [1/4]
plotting functions should work with any list of data, not just
tables... would probably want to plot from...
- [X] tables
- [ ] elisp lists
- [ ] results of property searches
- [ ] comma/tab seperated strings
** TODO add reading of parameters from elsewhere in the org-file
Currently reading from adjacent =#+PLOT= lines, but would also like to
read from the current subtree, or even global to the file

*** DONE comment lines
I can see good ways to specify parameters for a plot that would be quite
consistent with how Org deals with such things in similar situations.

1. A special comment line in the buffer, directly before the table, like

#+PLOT: table-to-gnuplot :xcol 1 :ycols (2 4 5 6) :title "Some string"

or

#+PLOT: table-to-R :script "/path/to/script"

The command can read these by macthing

(if (looking-at "#+PLOT: +\\([^ \t\r\n]+\\)\\( +.*\\)?")
     (let* ((func (intern (match-string 1)))
	   (params-plist
	    (if (match-end 2)
		(read (concat "(" (match-string 2 format) ")")))))

2. Use inherited properties to specify plotting parameters in a tree.

*** header properties
would like to jump up to header sub-trees to find plotting options if
none specified on near the table/link

** TODO bugs [5/6]
Thanks to the org-mode mailing list for reporting problems

- [X] after plotting 3d or grid data, sometime have to call the
      plotting command twice before the before a graph is generated
- [X] parentheses inside of quotes for title break the regexp,
      similarly "'s inside of ()'s will probably be a problem for
      specifying labels
- [ ] Got a "current buffer has no process" when tried from Windows
      Native GNU Emacs 22.2.1
- [X] can wander too far and read options from nearby graphs
- [X] sometimes graphs just don't work, many times saving the org-file
      and then re-graphing will fix this
- [X] changing the buffer

*** changing the buffer
this already happens whenever tab is pressed in a table.
